📌 TODO LIST APPLICATION
⏱ Time: 60 minutes
🛠 Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (No frameworks)
🧾 PROBLEM STATEMENT (INTERVIEW STYLE)

You are required to build a Todo List application that allows users to manage their daily tasks.

🔹 FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The application should have an input field where users can type a todo task.

There should be an “Add” button to add the task to the list.

When a task is added:

It should appear below the input field in a list.

Each todo item should have:

A checkbox to mark it as completed.

A delete button to remove the todo.

When a todo is marked as completed:

The text should appear crossed out (line-through).

Empty or whitespace-only todos must not be added.

🔹 NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS

The UI can be simple (no need for fancy styling).

Code should be clean and readable.

Do not use any JavaScript frameworks or libraries.

The solution should work in all modern browsers.

🔹 OPTIONAL (BONUS – NOT MANDATORY)

Clear input after adding a todo.

Pressing Enter should also add a todo.

Maintain todo list order.
