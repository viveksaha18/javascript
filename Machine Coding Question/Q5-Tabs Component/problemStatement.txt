🧩 Problem Statement: Tabs Component
📌 Description

You are required to build a Tabs Component using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

A tabs component allows users to switch between different sections of content without reloading the page.

🎯 Requirements

The page should contain three tabs:

Tab 1

Tab 2

Tab 3

Each tab should have its own content section:

When the user clicks on:

Tab 1 → Show content of Tab 1
