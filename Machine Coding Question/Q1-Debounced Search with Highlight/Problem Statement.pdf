📌 Problem Statement

Create a search box that filters a list of items as the user types.

Requirements

You are given a list of strings (names).

When the user types in the input box:

Filter the list based on the search term

Matching should be case-insensitive

Implement debouncing (300ms) so filtering doesn’t happen on every keystroke.

Highlight the matching part of the text.

If no results are found, show:
👉 "No results found"

If the input is empty, show all items.

🧪 Sample Data
const items = [
  "JavaScript",
  "Java",
  "Python",
  "C++",
  "React",
  "NodeJS",
  "Machine Learning",
  "Frontend Developer",
  "Backend Developer"
];

🖥 UI Expectations (Simple)

One input box

One list below it

👉 Styling is NOT important, functionality is.

🧩 Constraints

❌ No frameworks (React not allowed)

✅ Pure HTML, CSS, JS

❌ No libraries

✅ Clean JS functions

🔍 Edge Cases to Handle

Extra spaces in input

Upper/lowercase differences

Empty input

Fast typing

🧠 What Interviewers Will Look For

Debounce implementation

DOM updates

Clean JS logic

Separation of concerns

Readable variable names

✅ Expected Output Example

Input: ja
Output:

JavaScript

Java
